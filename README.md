Hello, Dear Friend.

In this repository I've published source of my little study about usage of abstract entities in ABAP.
You can open all files as text files or use visual studio code. All file exstension were taken arbitrary just to underline type of code within.
E.g. .cds means CDS source code, .bdef means behavior(BDEF) source code, .glob.cls means ABAP ADT Global Class section, .loctype.cls means Local Types section.

If you want to launch code in your ADT, just copy and past it in corresponding development source code object.
